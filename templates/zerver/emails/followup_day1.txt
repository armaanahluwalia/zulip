Hello there : )

Thank you for accepting your invititation to Loop Zero

Why Another Platform?
=====================
In a world with Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and a host of others, you might be wondering what this is all about. I believe we can connect the brightest minds in the country together and positively affect each others work, thoughts and beliefs.

Loop Zero is a curated group of the individuals who deeply understand the content they consume, create and share.

This is a closed community meaning all members are by invitation only. We want to create a place where each piece of information shared comes from someone who is deeply invested in a field who can filter out the noise in the vast amount of information out there.

How do I Use It?
================
There are a couple of ways Loop Zero is useful to its members:

As a passive reader: You could use Loop Zero to be informed about a particular field of interest. For example: If "Internet of Things" is of particular interest to you all you have to do is subscribe to that stream!
Share Content: To engage with the community and share content, all you have to do is create a new topic of conversation. Each Stream has a number of recently discussed topics. To create a new topic just click the New Topic button within a stream.

Is there a mobile app?
======================
Absolutely! Loop Zero leverages a software called Zulip. To use Loop zero on your cellphone or desktop computer we suggest downloading the Zulip desktop and mobile apps at https://zulipchat.com/apps.
