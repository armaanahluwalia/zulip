<h2>Why Another Platform?</h2>
<p>In a world with <b>Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp</b> and a host of others, you might be wondering
    what this is all about. I believe we can connect the brightest minds in the country together
    and positively affect each others work, thoughts and beliefs.
</p>
<p><b><span class="highlight"><em>Loop Zero</em> is a curated group of individuals who deeply understand the content they consume, create and share.</span></b></p>
<p>This is a closed community meaning all members are by invitation only. We want to create a place where each piece of information shared
    comes from someone who is <b>deeply invested in a field</b> who can filter out the noise in the vast amount of information out there.
</p>

<h2>How do I Use It?</h2>
<p>There are a couple of ways Loop Zero is useful:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>As a passive reader:</b> You could use Loop Zero to be informed about a particular field of interest. For example: If "Internet of Things" is of particular interest to you all you have to do is 
        <a href="{{ realm_uri }}#streams/all" target="_blank">subscribe to that stream!</a></li>
    <li><b>Share Content:</b> To engage with the community and share content, all you have to do is <em>create a new topic of conversation.</em>
            Each <em>Stream</em> has a number of recently discussed topics.
             To create a new topic just click the <em>New Topic </em> button within a stream.
        </li>
    
    </ul>
<h2>Is there a mobile app?</h2>
<p>
    Absolutely! Loop Zero leverages a software called <b>Zulip.</b> To use Loop zero on your cellphone or desktop computer 
    we suggest downloading the Zulip <a target="_blank" href="https://zulipchat.com/apps">desktop and mobile apps</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    To access your Loop Zero account from the apps, just enter this Organization URL when prompted:
 </p>

<p>
    <b>{{ realm_uri }}</b>
</p>
<p>
    {{ _("Cheers,") }}<br />
    {{ _("Armaan from Loop Zero") }}
</p>
