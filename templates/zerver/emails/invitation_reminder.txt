Why Another Platform?
=====================
In a world with Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp and a host of others, you might be wondering what this is all about. I believe we can connect the brightest minds in the country together and positively affect each others work, thoughts and beliefs.

Loop Zero is a curated group of the individuals who deeply understand the content they consume, create and share.

This is a closed community meaning all members are by invitation only. We want to create a place where each piece of information shared comes from someone who is deeply invested in a field who can filter out the noise in the vast amount of information out there.

How do I Use It?
================
There are a couple of ways Loop Zero is useful to its members:

As a passive reader: You could use Loop Zero to be informed about a particular field of interest. For example: If "Internet of Things" is of particular interest to you all you have to do is subscribe to that stream!
Share Content: To engage with the community and share content, all you have to do is create a new topic of conversation. Each Stream has a number of recently discussed topics. To create a new topic just click the New Topic button within a stream.

Is there a mobile app?
======================
Loop Zero for iOS on the App Store - https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/loop-zero/id1445613350?mt=8
Loop Zero for Android on the Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loopzero
